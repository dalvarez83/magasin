## About Magasin

Magasin (pronounced /ma.ɡa.zɛ̃/) is an end-to-end collection of open-source tools that are stitched together to provide enterprise ready automated ingestion, transformation, and storage as well as the enabling infrastructure and tools to perform data analysis, visualization of datasets and ML / AI.



## Brief history 

Magasin grew out of Office of Innovation's and Information and Communication Technology Division (ICTD) work to establish a [RapidPro](https://www.rapidpro.io) Data Warehouse to enable aggregation of global metrics across vendor instances.

Also informed by experiences of the [Magic Box](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/Magicbox) applied data science initiative, a range of components were evaluated and trialed with country offices to arrive at the current components and architecture.

In 2021, ICTD engaged one of its long term agreement vendors to assist with evolving the proof-of-concept into a minimum viable product (MVP).

In 2023, UNICEF started the journey to detach _Magasin_ from its organizational and cloud infrastructure dependencies, and release it as an open-source platform with the goal of becoming a [Digital Public Good](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/).
