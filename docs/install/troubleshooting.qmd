# Troubleshooting FAQ

Please check the questions below, if you cannot find the answer you can try asking to magasin's community within [our discussions forum](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/discussions).

## How can I set the kubernetes correct cluster in `kubectl`?

In case that you run `kubectl cluster-info` and it is not pointing to the kubernetes cluster you want to use for magasin you can use the following commands:

1. Get the list different contexts available

    ```sh
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```

    Which may output something like: 
    ```sh
    CURRENT   NAME                        CLUSTER                   AUTHINFO                                              NAMESPACE

              docker-desktop              docker-desktop            docker-desktop                                        default
    *         magasin                     docker-desktop            docker-desktop                                        default
              magasin-dev                 docker-desktop            docker-desktop                                        default
              minikube                    minikube                  minikube                                              default
    ```

2. Use the correct cluster (i.e. context). Currently, the context `magasin` is selected, but to use `magasin-dev` you can run this command:

    ```sh
    kubectl config use-context magasin-dev
    ```
