However, traditional assessment methods bring forth several challenges - these methods were not at scale or student level, making it difficult to obtain reliable data for the state to make informed decisions. Additionally, the time it took for data to reach the central department from traditional assessment methods was too long, as the process involved physical question paper preparation, exam conduction, answer sheet evaluation, result generation and then manually digitizing results, leading to a delay of up to three to four months.\r\n\r\nThe Saral solution replaces the old answer sheets with OMR-based answer sheets and allows teachers to scan the answer sheet through the Saral App. This process instantly digitizes data and allows the state to receive digitized data on the very same day of scanning. Quick and detailed information provided by Saral Assessments has empowered decision-makers to make data-driven choices and take prompt action to enhance educational outcomes in the state.\r\n\r\nThe state is now also planning for a pilot program to explore the use of Saral for other teacher-led activities such as new student admissions to schools. The app can be used to quickly scan admission forms of students and transfer the data to the state backend systems, resulting in significant saving of time for the teachers. \r\n"}, "openlicenses": [{"openLicense": "MIT", "openLicenseEvidenceURLs": "https://github.com/Sunbird-cQube/cQube_Base/blob/master/LICENSE"}], "clearOwnership": [{"clearOwnershipName": "EkStep Foundation", "clearOwnershipURL": "https://sunbird.org/software-license\r\n"}], "documentation": "https://cqube.sunbird.org,\r\nhttps://github.com/Sunbird-cQube/cQube_Base", "NonPII": {"collectsNonPII": "Yes", "nonPIIAccessMechanism": "cQube has a published API through which all metrics generated in cQube can be downloaded. cQube software has implemented many best practices to keep user data safe and secure.
