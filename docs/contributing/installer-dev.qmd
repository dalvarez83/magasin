The `[install-magasin.sh](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/installer/install-magasin.sh)` is a shell script that installs all the dependencies required to install magasin as well as setting up all the helm charts that compose magasin. 

You have more details about what it does, in the [advanced installation page](../install/advanced.qmd)

It has a companion that is the `[uninstall-script.sh](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/installer/uninstall-magasin.sh)`

The installer and uninstaller source code can be found under the [installer/]() folder within the main magasin repository.

## Installer tests

The installer includes several options, in order to verify these are working we have created a Github action that performs several tests in different operating systems. 

See the source code of [install-tests.yaml](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/.github/workflows/install-tests.yml)
