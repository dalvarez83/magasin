This is the first out of the three steps of the magasin tutorial.


# Run jupyter notebooks.

1. Download the jupyter-notebook.

[Download tutorial jupyter notebook](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/examples/dpg-insights/dpg-insights.ipynb){.btn-action-primary .btn-action .btn .btn-outline-primary  role="button"}.

The notebook is a file called [dpg-insights.ipynb](https://github.com/unicef/magasin/blob/main/examples/dpg-insights/dpg-insights.ipynb). We will use it later.

2. Launch Jupter Hub webpage on our cluster. 

    Run the command: 

    ```sh
    kubectl --namespace=magasin-daskhub get svc proxy-public 
    ```

    This will give you a table like this:

    ```sh
    NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
    proxy-public   LoadBalancer   10.107.249.99   localhost     80:31035/TCP   44m
    ```

    The `EXTERNAL-IP` value will give you the IP address in which the user interface of Jupyter hub is available. In our case, it is localhost.

 3. Open a browser pointing to the external IP. In the example above http://localhost


    This will display a login page
