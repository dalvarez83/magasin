## Authentication

Because the default setup is only for testing purposes, by default dask's Jupyterhub comes without authentication.

To setup the authentication mechanism you have all the documentation in: https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/administrator/authentication.html

Once you have created the yaml file that has the setup you can run `helm upgrade`
```sh
# helm upgrade <component> --namespace <component-namespace> --values <values-file.yaml>
helm upgrade daskhub --namespace magasin-daskhub --values daskhub.yaml
```
