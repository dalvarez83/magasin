## The challenge

In today's data-informed world, governments and organizations face a monumental challenge: fragmented data spread across siloed systems. Departments, divisions, and units gather data independently, leading to inefficiencies and risks:

### Fragmentation in tools and capacity

* **Tool Fragmentation:** Organizations, especially those without centralized structures, struggle with diverse technologies across teams, hindering resource mobility and causing technology duplication.

* **Capacity Issues:** Siloed work exacerbates resource allocation challenges, limiting the organization's overall potential.

### Risks of Data Breaches
* **Security Concerns:** Without secure data storage and sharing mechanisms, organizations risk data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

### Myopic Data Analysis
* **Lack of Comprehensive Insights:** Siloed data prevents organizations from gaining a holistic understanding of their operations and stakeholders, leading to shortsighted decision-making.

To overcome these challenges and unlock the full potential of modern data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, organizations need a comprehensive set of tools. 

## Marketplace gaps
When we go to the global market we find gaps.

### Overwhelming landscape

Entering the world of data can be daunting, with a myriad of products each requiring trade-offs. 

### Leaders are solving a specific problems set

Most data systems are optimized for massive scale and low-latency, crucial for time-sensitive tasks like targeted advertising. However, not all organizations face such time-pressured scenarios. 

### With systems that require a high cost entry

It is important to note that these data systems are not designed for low-end hardware or low cost of entry, further complicating the landscape for organizations exploring data solutions without having a deep pocket.

### That are proprietary

Traditional end-to-end data platforms often come with proprietary restrictions, limiting flexibility and tying organizations to specific cloud vendors or industry niches. 

This presents significant challenges for entities with decentralized structures and external collaborations, in particularly, UNICEF's government partners who demand a cloud-agnostic, open-source solution that delivers maximum value for their investment.

# Magasin was needed

![Core enabling capabilities](./images/enabling-capabilities.svg)

Our solution is a game-changer in the data landscape. We offer a democratized approach to data anaylsis, empowering organizations of all sizes and structures to harness the power of data without compromising on cost, flexibility and proprietary vendor lock-in. 

Magasin offers an open-source, cloud-native end-to-end solution covering data ingestion, storage, analysis, and visualization. Our [architecture](./architecture.qmd) is composed of loosely coupled, mature open-source solutions.

Magasin fits the needs of any public or private organizations that generate data from multiple data sources, that realized the need of performing data Science, ML/AI at scale.​

For the public sector and NGO organizations it is a cross-sectoral tool that can be implemented at the national, subnational, or department level.​

For the private sector it fits any organization that wants to leverage data science to keep relevant and improve business outcomes​ with a low cost as barrier of entry​ and with full control of the data.
